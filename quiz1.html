					<em>My movie of 2021, so far.</em>
					<br />
					It's been amazing being back in cinemas after last year, I have seen some good films, and some shockers, this though, is the first great film of the year for me.</p>

					<em>An overwhelming experience</em>
					<br />
					Dune is an experience made for cinema. Do yourself a favor, spend your money and don't wait for it to appear on streaming. The Visuals, music, and sheer epicness are overwhelming. These alone are worth your watch.</p></td>

					<em>Great visuals, poor storyline.</em>
					<br />
					Imagine someone that doing a Jigsaw puzzle, it's a complex puzzle, and they have a scissors, and rather than trying to put the puzzle together, they just cut bits off and squeeze them in, that's what I felt about this plot, what there was of one was just very thin, and hung together by very loose strands.</p>

					<br />
					<em>It puts the "dumb" in Dumbledore</em>
					<br />
					It's sometimes funny and often creative, and it's an improvement over its predecessor by default, simply because rather than only 5% of the plot being consequential, about 30% of the plot is consequential.</p></td>

				    <em>A wild ride</em>
				    <br />
				    Badland Hunters combines a lot of familiar elements for a post apocalyptic adventure that pushes through any narrative issues with its brutal action and the fact that this is a surprisingly funny film. Despite all the mutant soldiers, gangs and a mad scientist, this is one of the most civilised wastelands put to screen and there's a lot of charm in that.</p>
				    <p><strong>TreeFiddy5330 (January 2024):</strong>
				    <br />
				    <em>Let down</em>
				    <br />
				    I was really looking forward to Badland Hunters, but this turned out to be a let down. The plot is these action movies isn't usually anything new but this had a bunch of stuff going on that didn't add any value...? Action for the sake of it....tsk.</p></td>
